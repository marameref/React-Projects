A practical implementation of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in JavaScript. This project demonstrates how to use classes, constructors, and methods to manage a shopping cart system.

## 🚀 Features
- **Product Class**: Manages product metadata (ID, Name, Price).
- **ShoppingCartItem Class**: Handles the relationship between a product and its quantity.
- **ShoppingCart Class**: Manages a collection of items with methods to add, remove, and calculate totals.
- **Data Encapsulation**: Methods are used to interact with the internal state of the cart.
